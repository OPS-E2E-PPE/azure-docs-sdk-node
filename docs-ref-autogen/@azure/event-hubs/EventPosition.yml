      Represents the position of an event in an Event Hub partition, typically
      used when calling the `subscribe()`

      method on an `EventHubConsumerClient` to specify the position in the
      partition to begin receiving events from.

      To get an EventPosition representing the start or end of the stream, use
      the constants

      `earliestEventPosition` and `latestEventPosition` respectively.

      The enqueued time in UTC of the event identified by this position.

      When provided as a number this value is the number of milliseconds since
      the Unix Epoch.

      Expected to be undefined if the position is just created from a sequence
      number or an offset.

      This information is only relevent if the event position was identified by
      an offset or sequence number.

      The offset of the event identified by this position.

      number or an enqueued time.


      The offset is the relative position for an event in the context of the
      partition.

      The offset should not be considered a stable value.

      The same offset may refer to a different event as events reach the age
      limit for

      retention and are no longer visible within the partition.
