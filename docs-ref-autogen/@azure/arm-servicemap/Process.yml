      A process resource represents a process running on a machine. The process
      may be actively

      *monitored*, i.e., a Dependency Agent is running on its machine, or
      *discovered*, i.e., its

      existence was inferred by observing the data stream from monitored
      machines. A process resource

      represents a pool of actual operating system resources that share command
      lines and metadata. As

      the process pool evolves over time, prior versions of the process resource
      are preserved and

      available for access. A process is live during an interval of time, if
      that process is executing

      during (parts) of that interval
