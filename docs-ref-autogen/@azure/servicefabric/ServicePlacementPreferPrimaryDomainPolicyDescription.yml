      Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
      where the service's

      Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a particular domain.

      This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios
      where the Service Fabric

      cluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate that a
      service's primary replica

      should be located in a particular fault domain, which in geo-distributed
      scenarios usually

      aligns with regional or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an
      optimization it is

      possible that the Primary replica may not end up located in this domain
      due to failures,

      capacity limits, or other constraints.
