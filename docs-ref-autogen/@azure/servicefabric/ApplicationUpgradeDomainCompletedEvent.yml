      The identity of the application. This is an encoded representation of the
      application name.

      This is used in the REST APIs to identify the application resource.

      Starting in version 6.0, hierarchical names are delimited with the "\~"
      character. For

      example, if the application name is "fabric:/myapp/app1",

      the application identity would be "myapp\~app1" in 6.0+ and "myapp/app1"
      in previous versions.
