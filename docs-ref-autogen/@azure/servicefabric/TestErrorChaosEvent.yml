      Describes a Chaos event that gets generated when an unexpected event
      occurs in the Chaos engine.

      For example, due to the cluster snapshot being inconsistent, while
      faulting an entity, Chaos

      found that the entity was already faulted -- which would be an unexpected
      event.

      Describes why TestErrorChaosEvent was generated. For example, Chaos tries
      to fault a partition

      but finds that the partition is no longer fault tolerant, then a
      TestErrorEvent gets generated

      with the reason stating that the partition is not fault tolerant.
