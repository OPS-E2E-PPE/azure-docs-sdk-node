      The list of deployed applications in activating, downloading, or active
      states on a node.

      The list is paged when all of the results cannot fit in a single message.

      The next set of results can be obtained by executing the same query with
      the continuation token

      provided in this list.

      The continuation token parameter is used to obtain next set of results.
      The continuation token

      is included in the response of the API when the results from the system do
      not fit in a single

      response. When this value is passed to the next API call, the API returns
      next set of results.

      If there are no further results, then the continuation token is not
      included in the response.
