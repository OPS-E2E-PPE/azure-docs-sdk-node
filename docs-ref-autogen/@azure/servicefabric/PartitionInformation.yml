      An internal ID used by Service Fabric to uniquely identify a partition.
      This is a randomly

      generated GUID when the service was created. The partition ID is unique
      and does not change

      for the lifetime of the service. If the same service was deleted and
      recreated the IDs of its

      partitions would be different.
