      Allows filtering of the application health state objects returned in the

      The possible values for this parameter include integer value obtained from
      members or bitwise

      operations

      on members of HealthStateFilter enumeration. Only applications that match
      the filter are

      returned.

      All applications are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not
      specified, all

      entries are returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a
      combination of these

      values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of applications
      with HealthState

      value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn't match any HealthState value. Used in order to
