      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy partitions per service.
      Allowed values are Byte

      values from zero to 100

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions
      that can be unhealthy

      before the service is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
      partition, the health is

      evaluated as Warning.

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy
      partitions over the total

      number of partitions in the service.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      partitions. Default

      percentage is zero. Default value: 0.

      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy replicas per partition.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of replicas
      that can be unhealthy

      before the partition is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
      replica, the health is

      evaluated as Warning.

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy replicas
      over the total

      number of replicas in the partition.

      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy services. Allowed values are
      Byte values from zero

      to 100.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of services
      that can be unhealthy

      before the application is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy
      service, the health is

      evaluated as Warning.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the
      specific service type

      over the total number of services of the specific service type.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of
      services. Default

      percentage is zero. Default value: 0.
