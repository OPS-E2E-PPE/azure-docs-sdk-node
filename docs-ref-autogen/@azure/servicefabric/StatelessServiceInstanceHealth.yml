      The HealthState representing the aggregated health state of the entity

      Manager.

      The health evaluation of the entity reflects all events reported on the
      entity and its

      children (if any).

      The aggregation is done by applying the desired health policy. Possible
      values include:

      'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'
