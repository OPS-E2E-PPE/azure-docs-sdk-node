      Compares the Sequence Number of a property with the SequenceNumber
      argument.

      A property's sequence number can be thought of as that property's version.

      Every time the property is modified, its sequence number is increased.

      The sequence number can be found in a property's metadata.

      The comparison fails if the sequence numbers are not equal.

      CheckSequencePropertyBatchOperation is generally used as a precondition
      for the write operations

      in the batch.

      Note that if one PropertyBatchOperation in a PropertyBatch fails,

      the entire batch fails and cannot be committed in a transactional manner.
