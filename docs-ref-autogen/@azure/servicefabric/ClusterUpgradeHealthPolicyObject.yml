      The maximum allowed percentage of nodes health degradation allowed during
      cluster upgrades.

      The delta is measured between the state of the nodes at the beginning of
      upgrade and the state

      of the nodes at the time of the health evaluation. The check is performed
      after every upgrade

      domain upgrade completion to make sure the global state of the cluster is
      within tolerated

      limits. The default value is 10%.
