      The HealthState representing the aggregated health state of the entity
      computed by Health

      Manager.

      The health evaluation of the entity reflects all events reported on the
      entity and its

      children (if any).

      The aggregation is done by applying the desired health policy. Possible
      values include:

      'Invalid', 'Ok', 'Warning', 'Error', 'Unknown'

      Id of a stateful service replica. ReplicaId is used by Service Fabric to
      uniquely identify a

      replica of a partition. It is unique within a partition and does not

      of the replica. If a replica gets dropped and another replica gets created
      on the same node

      for the same partition, it will get a different value for the id.
      Sometimes the id of a

      stateless service instance is also referred as a replica id.
