      Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
      where two replicas

      from the same partition should never be placed in the same fault or
      upgrade domain.

      While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of
      concurrent failures

      due to unplanned outages or other cases of subsequent/concurrent failures.
      As an example,

      consider a case where replicas are deployed across different data center,
      with one replica per

      location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally
      the replica that was

      placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of the remaining
      datacenters. If this is not

      desirable then this policy should be set.
