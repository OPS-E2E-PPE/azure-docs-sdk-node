    summary: >-
      The name of the language analyzer to use for the field. This option can be
      used only with

      searchable fields and it can't be set together with either searchAnalyzer
      or indexAnalyzer.

      Once the analyzer is chosen, it cannot be changed for the field.

      KnownAnalyzerNames is an enum containing known values.

  - name: facetable
    uid: '@azure/search-documents.SimpleField.facetable'
    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      A value indicating whether to enable the field to be referenced in facet
      queries. Typically

      used in a presentation of search results that includes hit count by
      category (for example,

      search for digital cameras and see hits by brand, by megapixels, by price,
      and so on).

      Fields of type Edm.GeographyPoint or Collection(Edm.GeographyPoint) cannot
      be facetable.

      Default is false for all other simple fields.

  - name: filterable
    uid: '@azure/search-documents.SimpleField.filterable'
    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      A value indicating whether to enable the field to be referenced in $filter
      queries. Filterable

      differs from searchable in how strings are handled. Fields of type
      Edm.String or

      Collection(Edm.String) that are filterable do not undergo word-breaking,
      so comparisons are

      for exact matches only. For example, if you set such a field f to "sunny
      day", $filter=f eq

      'sunny' will find no matches, but $filter=f eq 'sunny day' will.

      Default is false.

      A value indicating whether the field can be returned in a search result.
      You can enable this

      option if you want to use a field (for example, margin) as a filter,
      sorting, or scoring

      mechanism but do not want the field to be visible to the end user. This
      property must be false

      for key fields. This property can be changed on existing fields.

      Disabling this property does not cause any increase in index storage
      requirements.

      Default is false.

      A value indicating whether the field uniquely identifies documents in the
      index. Exactly one

      top-level field in each index must be chosen as the key field and it must
      be of type

      Edm.String. Key fields can be used to look up documents directly and
      update or delete specific

      documents. Default is false.

  - name: searchable
    uid: '@azure/search-documents.SimpleField.searchable'
    package: '@azure/search-documents'
    summary: >-
      A value indicating whether the field is full-text searchable. This means
      it will undergo

      analysis such as word-breaking during indexing. If you set a searchable
      field to a value like

      "sunny day", internally it will be split into the individual tokens
      "sunny" and "day". This

      enables full-text searches for these terms. This property must be false
      for simple

      fields of other non-string data types.

      Note: searchable fields consume extra space in your index since Azure
      Cognitive Search will store an

      additional tokenized version of the field value for full-text searches.

      Defaults to false for simple fields.

    summary: >-
      A value indicating whether to enable the field to be referenced in
      $orderby expressions. By

      default Azure Cognitive Search sorts results by score, but in many
      experiences users will want

      to sort by fields in the documents. A simple field can be sortable only if
      it is single-valued

      (it has a single value in the scope of the parent document). Simple
      collection fields cannot

      be sortable, since they are multi-valued. Simple sub-fields of complex
      collections are also

      multi-valued, and therefore cannot be sortable. This is true whether it's
      an immediate parent

      field, or an ancestor field, that's the complex collection. The default
      for sortable is false.

      synonym map to a field ensures that query terms targeting that field are
