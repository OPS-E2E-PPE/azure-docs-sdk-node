      Allocation state. Allocation state of the compute. Possible values are:
      steady - Indicates

      that the compute is not resizing. There are no changes to the number of
      compute nodes in the

      compute in progress. A compute enters this state when it is created and
      when no operations are

      being performed on the compute to change the number of compute nodes.
      resizing - Indicates

      that the compute is resizing; that is, compute nodes are being added to or
      removed from the

      compute. Possible values include: 'Steady', 'Resizing'
