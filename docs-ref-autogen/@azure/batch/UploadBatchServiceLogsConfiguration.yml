      finish. The start

      time for SAS is optional and recommended to not be specified.

      that the operation

      might retrieve more logs than have been requested since the entire log
      file is always

      uploaded, but the operation should not retrieve fewer logs than have been
      requested. If

      omitted, the default is to upload all logs available after the startTime.
