    summary: >-
      The exit code of the program specified on the start task command line.
      This property is set

      only if the start task is in the completed state. In general, the exit
      code for a process

      reflects the specific convention implemented by the application developer
      for that process. If

      you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that
      you know the exit

      code convention used by the application process. However, if the Batch
      service terminates the

      start task (due to timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see
      an operating

      system-defined exit code.

      only if the task was retried (i.e. retryCount is nonzero). If present,
      this is typically the

      same as startTime, but may be different if the task has been restarted for
      reasons other than

      retry; for example, if the compute node was rebooted during a retry, then
      the startTime is

      updated but the lastRetryTime is not.
