    summary: >-
      The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which the
      compute nodes of the pool

      will join. This is of the form

      /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure Batch account.

      The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate
      the number of nodes

      in the pool. If the subnet doesn't have enough free IP addresses, the pool
      will partially

      allocate compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. For pools created
      with

      virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks
      ('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks')

      are supported, but for pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both
      ARM and classic

      virtual networks are supported. For more details, see:
