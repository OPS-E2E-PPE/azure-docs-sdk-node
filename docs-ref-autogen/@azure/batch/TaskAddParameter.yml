      Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute
      node. Examples of

      recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy
      compute node is rebooted

      or a compute node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery
      operations are

      independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if
      the maxTaskRetryCount

      is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of
      this, all tasks should

      be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and
      restarted without causing

      any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running tasks
      is to use some form

      of checkpointing.
