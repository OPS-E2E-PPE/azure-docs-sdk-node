      The exit code of the program specified on the task command line. This
      property is set only if

      the task is in the completed state. In general, the exit code for a
      process reflects the

      specific convention implemented by the application developer for that
      process. If you use the

      exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that you know the
      exit code convention

      used by the application process. However, if the Batch service terminates
      the task (due to

      timeout, or user termination via the API) you may see an operating
      system-defined exit code.

      reasons other than

      retry; for example, if the compute node was rebooted during a retry, then
