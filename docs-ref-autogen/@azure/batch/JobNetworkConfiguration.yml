    summary: >-
      The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network subnet which nodes
      running tasks from the

      job will join for the duration of the task. This is only supported for
      jobs running on

      VirtualMachineConfiguration pools. This is of the form

      /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

      The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the
      Azure Batch account.

      The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate
      the number of nodes

      which will run tasks from the job. For more details, see

      https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration.
