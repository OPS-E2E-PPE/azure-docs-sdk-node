      The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the
      following: The user calls the

      Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while the job is still active,
      the job's maximum wall

      clock time constraint is reached, and the job is still active, or the
      job's Job Manager task

      completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager
      completes. The Job

      Release task runs on each compute node where tasks of the job have run and
      the Job Preparation

      task ran and completed. If you reimage a compute node after it has run the
      Job Preparation task,

      and the job ends without any further tasks of the job running on that
      compute node (and hence

      the Job Preparation task does not re-run), then the Job Release task does
      not run on that node.

      If a compute node reboots while the Job Release task is still running, the
      Job Release task runs

      again when the compute node starts up. The job is not marked as complete
      until all Job Release

      tasks have completed. The Job Release task runs in the background. It does
      not occupy a

      scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the maxTasksPerNode
      limit specified on the

      pool.

      The command line of the Job Release task. The command line does not run
      under a shell, and

      variable expansion. If

      you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell
      in the command line,

      for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand"
      in Linux. If the

      command line refers to file paths, it should use a relative path (relative
      to the task working

      directory), or use the Batch provided environment variable

      (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-compute-node-environment-variables).
