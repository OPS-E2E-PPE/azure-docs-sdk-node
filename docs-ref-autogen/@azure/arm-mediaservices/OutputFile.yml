      The list of labels that describe how the encoder should multiplex video
      and audio into an

      output file. For example, if the encoder is producing two video layers
      with labels v1 and v2,

      and one audio layer with label a1, then an array like '[v1, a1]' tells the
      encoder to produce

      an output file with the video track represented by v1 and the audio track
      represented by a1.
    syntax:
      content: 'labels: string[]'
      return:
        type:
          - 'string[]'
